# iOSWeatherApplication
## Final Project for my Application Dev class

Simple iOS Weather Application fetching data from Dark Sky's Weather API

Enter a city (if there are duplicates enter state also (ex: Columbia Missouri)) 
and the 7 day forecast will be fetched

If you click on an indiviudal day, it will segue you to the specific details for that day.
Overall functionality it working, just need to parse individual day's data in order to display
them on the segues
